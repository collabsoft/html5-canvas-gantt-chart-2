# Gantt chart

This is a hand-made implementation of a relatively simple Gantt chart. This new implementation uses HTML5 Canvas API instead of D3.

See the description, screenshots and more details on [my blog](https://shybovycha.github.io/2021/03/04/gantt-chart-part3.html).

## Building

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn build
```

Then, open `example.html` file in your browser.

## Demo

You can see the example (`example.html`) live, on [my blog](https://shybovycha.github.io/2021/03/04/gantt-chart-part3.html).
