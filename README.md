# Gantt chart

This is a hand-made implementation of a relatively simple Gantt chart. This new implementation uses HTML5 Canvas API instead of D3.

See the description, screenshots and more details on [my blog](https://shybovycha.github.io/2021/03/04/gantt-chart-part3.html).

## Building

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn build
$ yarn start
```

Then, open [localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/) in your browser.
